# Repros for TypeScript

This is a lightway-ish way for me to provide multi-file repros on TypeScript.
Each repro should have its own branch (which might get deleted).

If you need to open up a different repro, [consider creating a git worktree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) to work in a different directory.
